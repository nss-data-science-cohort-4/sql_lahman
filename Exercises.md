1. Find all players in the database who played at Vanderbilt University. Create a list showing each playerâ€™s first and last names as well as the total salary they earned in the major leagues. Sort this list in descending order by the total salary earned. Which Vanderbilt player earned the most money in the majors?

2. Using the fielding table, group players into three groups based on their position: label players with position OF as "Outfield", those with position "SS", "1B", "2B", and "3B" as "Infield", and those with position "P" or "C" as "Battery". Determine the number of putouts made by each of these three groups in 2016.

3. Find the player who had the most success stealing bases in 2016, where __success__ is measured as the percentage of stolen base attempts which are successful. (A stolen base attempt results either in a stolen base or being caught stealing.) Consider only players who attempted _at least_ 20 stolen bases. Report the players' names, number of stolen bases, number of attempts, and stolen base percentage.

4. Which pitcher was the least efficient in 2016 in terms of salary / strikeouts? Only consider pitchers who started at least 10 games (across all teams). Note that pitchers often play for more than one team in a season, so be sure that you are counting all stats for each player.

5. Find all players who have had at least 3000 career hits. Report those players' names, total number of hits, and the year they were inducted into the hall of fame (If they were not inducted into the hall of fame, put a null in that column.) Note that a player being inducted into the hall of fame is indicated by a 'Y' in the inducted column of the halloffame table.

6. Find all players who had at least 1,000 hits for two different teams. Report those players' full names.

7. Find all players who hit their career highest number of home runs in 2016. Consider only players who have played in the league for at least 10 years, and who hit at least one home run in 2016. Report the players' first and last names and the number of home runs they hit in 2016.
